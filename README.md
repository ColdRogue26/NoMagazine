So this mod does exactly what the name states:
It removes all magazines from all weapons. Be it Gatlings, Pulses, Turrets or Main Guns - NO MAGAZINES!

This is the unbalanced version. So only thing that changed is the magazine size. No damage changed nothing.
I am currently working on the balanced version, that will change magazines, damage, range (maybe).

Have fun!


Mod changes base game and dlc guns. DLC are optional.
